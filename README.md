# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard

I created a Road Accident Analysis Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to help users quickly understand road accident trends and patterns for the years 2021 and 2022.

The dashboard includes several primary and secondary key performance indicators (KPIs) that are critical for understanding accident trends. The primary KPIs include total casualties and total accidents for the current year(2022) and YoY growth. The dashboard also includes primary KPIs that show total casualties by accident severity for the current year and YoY growth. These metrics help users understand how accident severity has changed over time.

In addition to the primary KPIs, the dashboard includes several secondary KPIs. These include total casualties by vehicle type for the current year. This metric helps users understand the types of vehicles that are involved in accidents.

The dashboard also includes a monthly trend that compares the casualties for the current year to the previous year. This trend helps users understand how accident patterns have changed over time. Additionally, the dashboard shows casualties by road type for the current year. This metric helps users understand which road types are most dangerous.

The dashboard also includes information about casualties by location. Users can view current year casualties by area/location and by day/night. This information helps users understand where accidents are most likely to occur and when they are most likely to occur. Finally, the dashboard shows total casualties and total accidents by location. This information helps users understand which areas have the highest number of accidents.

Overall, the Road Accident Analysis Dashboard is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to understand road accident trends and patterns. The dashboard provides users with a clear and concise view of key metrics, making it easy to identify areas for improvement and take action to reduce the number of accidents on the road.
